# Plua

Plua is an programming language interpreted (At least for now). The interpreter is written in python.

## Token and Ops

An Op is defined only for the keywords.
All words in Plua are first tokens but only keywords are changed to be Ops.

## Parentheses

When an argument for a function is a paren and there are Tokens and Ops inside, the argument passed to that function is the result of the execution of the arguments inside these parens.
